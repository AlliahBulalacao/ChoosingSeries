In this program, I learned about using the 'random' module, it is a built-in module in Python. 
Based on my research, this function is used to generate random numbers. 
It can also used in generating a value of a list or string. 
Since, I have some background in creating a list, the program is much more easier. 
If I have follow the Jikanpy, I think the program will be much more interesting since there are a lot of animes to choose from. 
However, I only have limited amount of time, thus learning jikanpy module would take a lot of time. 
Futhermore, there are some downsides using it, Jikan just have the list for anime and it doesn't cover the movie or series that I want to add in the project.  

This is the link of the youtube video that I have watched, and followed.
