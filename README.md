In this program, I learned about using the 'random' module, it is a built-in module in Python. 
Based on my research, this function is used to generate random numbers. 
It can also used in generating a value of a list or string. 
Since, I have some background in creating a list, the program is much more easier. 
In the video that I have watched, the youtuber introduce the jikanpy module. The module is an Application Programming Interface (API) which has an AnimeList. 
If I have follow the Jikanpy, I think the program will be much more interesting since there are a lot of animes to choose from. 
However, I only have limited amount of time, thus learning jikanpy module would take a lot of time. 
Futhermore, there are some downsides using it, Jikan just have the list for anime and it doesn't cover the movie or series that I want to add in the project.  

In my program, I manually added the title of the animes, movies and series that the random module can pick from. There are 15 vallues in every list.
